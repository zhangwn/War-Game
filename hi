Yo Dexin what's up?
Anyways, testing this was successful. Now that we both have an idea of how GitHub works, try downloading unity and learn how to use it.
The C# scripting shuold look very similar to Java (if you know how to use it)
Alternatively, you can use Javascript, but less people do that.
Let me know once you learn the basics of unity.

i don't need to pull it to edit?
I just click the edit button.
